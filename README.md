# Medimind-AI
### Mission-critical AI for deep space medical autonomy                                                                                                                 
Built using Microsoft BioGPT and a custom astronaut health data system.

## Overview

Long-duration missions (Moon, Mars, and beyond) donâ€™t have the luxury of real-time medical advice from Earth.
Medimind-AI acts as an onboard medical assistant powered by BioGPT, capable of:

- Managing astronaut medical profiles

- Monitoring vital signs and mission-specific health data

- Detecting anomalies (oxygen, heart rate, radiation exposure, etc.)

- Generating AI-driven medical summaries and insights
